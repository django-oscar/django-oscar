Near to the coast,  sea conditions are more complex: winds and currents change in strength  and direction, often unpredictably, waves are distorted by shallows,  and even in fine weather there are tidal races, tricky headlands and  other areas of rough water that can increase the risks of human error,  gear failure and seasickness.  Many  of the recommended techniques used in offshore voyaging - such as lying  to a sea anchor or trailing warps - are not suitable when close to  land. In this highly practical guide, filled with helpful tips,  real-time techniques and sound advice borne of years of first hand  experience, Ken Endean explains the phenomena of rough water and shows  how a good understanding of coastal sea conditions and careful passage  planning should enable boaters to avoid the roughest areas, seek  shelter underway and thereby reduce passage times.  He includes  advice on: coastal winds and waves, shallow water and shoaling, swells  and currents, tides and currents in conflict, estuary effects, bars and  banks, when to take the long way, how to read the surface, getting into  harbour safely, making the most of smooth water, and much more.
