It doesn't require extended time off work, or linguistic ability if things go wrong - and the coastline is beautiful! This book is a practical guide and Sam gives advice on planning and preparation: when to leave, whether to go clockwise or anti, what charts are needed, how much it is likely to cost, possible routes (via canals or 'the long way'), what stores and equipment are needed, likely pitfalls en route, and what types of running maintenance might be required. For the second edition she has added a '10 of the best' section detailing 'unmissable' places in a range of categories from remote bays and beautiful rivers to historic locations and anchorages. UK and Ireland Circumnavigator's Guide is perfect for all those sailors and motorboaters planning as well as dreaming of one day circumnavigating Britain's beautiful islands.
