It didn't occur to me that 'see my boat' might mean actually going out in the wretched tub in the winter. But I was newly in love and would have - in fact did- follow him anywhere. However, I quickly realised that crew require that geometrical, spatial capability that I simply don't have. By the time I've worked out the wind direction, the required point of sailing, the angle of the sail, where the tiller is and where it should be, we've perished. Anything that happens on water arouses a primal suspicion in me.'Before she realises what she's done, Angela has not only married a mad sailor, but has also agreed to go out on the water with him, in a boat they've bought, right out to sea...

Standalone,9781408127025,"Coastal Turmoil: Winds, Waves And Tidal Races","Most boating is done in coastal waters, yet being close to land can  often present greater dangers than sailing offshore. Near to the coast,  sea conditions are more complex: winds and currents change in strength  and direction, often unpredictably, waves are distorted by shallows,  and even in fine weather there are tidal races, tricky headlands and  other areas of rough water that can increase the risks of human error,  gear failure and seasickness.  Many  of the recommended techniques used in offshore voyaging - such as lying  to a sea anchor or trailing warps - are not suitable when close to  land. In this highly practical guide, filled with helpful tips,  real-time techniques and sound advice borne of years of first hand  experience, Ken Endean explains the phenomena of rough water and shows  how a good understanding of coastal sea conditions and careful passage  planning should enable boaters to avoid the roughest areas, seek  shelter underway and thereby reduce passage times.  He includes  advice on: coastal winds and waves, shallow water and shoaling, swells  and currents, tides and currents in conflict, estuary effects, bars and  banks, when to take the long way, how to read the surface, getting into  harbour safely, making the most of smooth water, and much more.  Coastal  boaters have little scope for mistakes and plenty of opportunities to  exercise skill and sound seamanship - this practical down-to-earth book  will enable everyone, whether in a yacht or a powerboat, to do just  that.",Books > General,Ingram,9781408127025,32.99,10,Paperback,160,A & C BLACK PUBLISHERS LTD,English,24/08/2010,460,Ken Endean

He wrote them faster than the magazine could print them. Clearly, he loved what he was doing. When Howard could write no more, he went on to draft Conan and the aforementioned Elkins, who owes much in style and content to the Costigan stories. The fight stories are a joy to read and reread.
