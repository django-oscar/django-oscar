    For taking the details of payment and creating the order.

    This view class is used by two separate URLs: 'payment-details' and

    being used. Chronologically, `payment-details` (preview=False) comes before
    `preview` (preview=True).

    If sensitive details are required (eg a bankcard), then the payment details
    view should submit to the preview URL and a custom implementation of
    `validate_payment_submission` should be provided.

    - If the form data is valid, then the preview template can be rendered with
      the payment-details forms re-rendered within a hidden div so they can be
      re-submitted when the 'place order' button is clicked. This avoids having
      to write sensitive data to disk anywhere during the process. This can be
      done by calling `render_preview`, passing in the extra template context
      vars.

    - If the form data is invalid, then the payment details templates needs to
      be re-rendered with the relevant error messages. This can be done by
      calling `render_payment_details`, passing in the form instances to pass
      to the templates.
