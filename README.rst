===================================
Domain-driven e-commerce for Django
===================================

Oscar is an e-commerce framework for Django designed for building
domain-driven e-commerce sites.  It is structured such that any part of the
core functionality can be customised to suit the needs of your project.  This
allows it to handle a wide range of e-commerce requirements, from large-scale B2C
sites to complex B2B sites rich in domain-specific business logic.

Oscar is used in production by:

* Tata - http://www.landmarkonthenet.com
* Carlsberg's global business platform is powered by Oscar.
* Dolbeau - http://www.dolbeau.ca/
* The UK Labour party
