===================================
Domain-driven e-commerce for Django
===================================

Oscar is an e-commerce framework for Django designed for building
domain-driven e-commerce sites.  It is structured such that any part of the
core functionality can be customised to suit the needs of your project.  This
allows it to handle a wide range of e-commerce requirements, from large-scale B2C
sites to complex B2B sites rich in domain-specific business logic.

More information:

* `Official homepage`_ 
* `Sandbox site`_ (an hourly build of the unstable master branch - it's
  experimental but feel free to explore and get a feel for the base Oscar
  install) 
* `Documentation`_ on the excellent `readthedocs.org`_
* `Google Group`_ - the mailing list is django-oscar@googlegroups.com
* `Continuous integration homepage`_ on `travis-ci.org`_
* `Twitter account for news and updates`_
* `Twitter account of all commits`_

Case studies
------------

Oscar is still in active development, but is used in production by a range of
companies, from large multinationals to small, boutique stores:

* Tata Group - http://www.landmarkonthenet.com
* Carlsberg - Their global "We Deliver More" platform is powered by Oscar (but
  is a B2B site so it not browsable by the public).
* Dolbeau - http://www.dolbeau.ca/
* The UK Labour party - http://shop.labour.org.uk (will be live in early June)

Many more on the way.
