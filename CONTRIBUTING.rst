Contributing
============

Some ground rules:

* To avoid disappointment, new features should be discussed on the mailing list
  (django-oscar@googlegroups.com) before serious work starts. 

* Write tests! Pull requests will be rejected if sufficient tests aren't
  provided.  See the guidance below on the testing conventions that Oscar uses.

* Write docs! Please update the documentation when altering behaviour or introducing new features.

* Write good commit messages: see `Tim Pope's excellent note`_.

.. _`Tim Pope's excellent note`: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

* Make pull requests against Oscar's master branch unless instructed otherwise.

Installation
============

After forking, run::

    git clone git@github.com:<username>/django-oscar.git
    cd django-oscar
    mkvirtualenv oscar  # using virtualenvwrapper
    make install

Running tests
=============

Oscar uses a nose_ testrunner which can be invoked using::

    ./runtests.py

.. _nose: http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

To run a subset of tests, you can use filesystem or module paths.  These two
commands will run the same set of tests::

    ./runtests.py tests/unit/order
    ./runtests.py tests.unit.order

To run an individual test class, use one of::

    ./runtests.py tests/unit/order:TestSuccessfulOrderCreation
    ./runtests.py tests.unit.order:TestSuccessfulOrderCreation

(Note the ':'.)

To run an individual test, use one of::

    ./runtests.py tests/unit/order:TestSuccessfulOrderCreation.test_creates_order_and_line_models
    ./runtests.py tests.unit.order:TestSuccessfulOrderCreation.test_creates_order_and_line_models

Oscar's testrunner uses the progressive_ plugin when running all tests, but uses
the spec_ plugin when running a subset.  It is a good practice to name your test
cases and methods so that the spec output reads well.  For example::

    $ ./runtests.py tests/unit/offer/benefit_tests.py:TestAbsoluteDiscount
    nosetests --verbosity 1 tests/unit/offer/benefit_tests.py:TestAbsoluteDiscount -s -x --with-spec
    Creating test database for alias 'default'...

    Absolute discount
    - consumes all lines for multi item basket cheaper than threshold
    - consumes all products for heterogeneous basket
    - consumes correct quantity for multi item basket more expensive than threshold
    - correctly discounts line
    - discount is applied to lines
    - gives correct discount for multi item basket cheaper than threshold
    - gives correct discount for multi item basket more expensive than threshold
    - gives correct discount for multi item basket with max affected items set
    - gives correct discount for single item basket cheaper than threshold
    - gives correct discount for single item basket equal to threshold
    - gives correct discount for single item basket more expensive than threshold
    - gives correct discounts when applied multiple times
    - gives correct discounts when applied multiple times with condition
    - gives no discount for a non discountable product
    - gives no discount for an empty basket

Playing in the sandbox
======================

Oscar ships with a 'sandbox' site which can be run locally to play around with
Oscar using a browser.  Set it up by::

   make sandbox 
   cd sites/sandbox 
   ./manage.py runserver

This will create the database and load some fixtures for categories and shipping
countries.

Note that Oscar uses PIL_ and Sorl_ for thumbnailing, and so you will need
``libjpeg-dev`` installed in your OS so that your PIL installation supports
JPEGS.

.. _PIL: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
.. _Sorl: http://sorl-thumbnail.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Vagrant
=======

Oscar ships with a Vagrant_ virtual machine that can be used to test integration
with various services in a controlled environment.  For instance, it is used to
test that the migrations run correctly in both MySQL and Postgres.

.. _Vagrant: http://vagrantup.com/

Building the Vagrant machine
----------------------------

To create the machine, first ensure that Vagrant and puppet_ are installed.  You will require a
puppet version that supports ``puppet module install``, that is > 2.7.14.  Now
run::

    make puppet

.. _puppet: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/installation.html

to fetch the required puppet modules for provisioning.  Finally, run::

    vagrant up

to create the virtual machine and provision it.

Testing migrations against MySQL and Postgres
---------------------------------------------

To test the migrations against MySQL and Postgres, do the following:

1. SSH onto the VM::

    vagrant ssh

2. Change to sandbox folder and activate virtualenv::

    cd /vagrant/sites/sandbox
    source /var/www/virtualenv/bin/activate

3. Run helper script::

    ./test_migrations.sh

    This will recreate the Oscar database in both MySQL and Postgres and rebuild
    it using ``syncdb`` and ``migrate``.

Testing WSGI server configurations
----------------------------------

You can browse the Oscar sandbox site in two ways:

* Start Django's development server on port 8000::

    vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant/sites/sandbox
    source /var/www/virtualenv/bin/activate
    ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

  The Vagrant machine forwards port 8000 to post 8080 and so the site can be
  accessed at http://localhost:8080 on your host machine.

* The Vagrant machine install Apache2 and mod_wsgi.  You can browse the site
  through Apache at http://localhost:8081 on your host machine.

Writing LESS/CSS
================

The sandbox Oscar site defaults to serving the CSS files directly, bypassing
LESS compilation.  If you want to develop the LESS files, set::

    USE_LESS = True
    COMPRESS_ENABLED = False

in ``sites/sandbox/settings_local.py``.  You will also need to ensure that
``lessc`` is installed.  This can be acheived by running::

    pip install -r requirements_less.txt

which will install the `virtual-node`_ and `virtual-less`_ packages, which will
install node.js and LESS in your virtualenv.

.. _`virtual-node`: https://github.com/elbaschid/virtual-node
.. _`virtual-less`: https://github.com/elbaschid/virtual-less


Writing docs
============

There's a helper script for building the docs locally::

    cd docs
    ./test_docs.sh

The actual docs are in ``/docs/source``. This directory structure is a
simplified version of what Django does.

* ``internals/`` contains everything related to Oscar itself, e.g. contributing
  guidelines or design philosophies.
* ``ref/`` is the reference documentation, esp. consisting of
* ``ref/apps/`` which should be a guide to each Oscar core app, explaining it's
  function, the main models, how it relates to the other apps, etc.
* ``topics/`` will contain "meta" articles, explaining how things tie together
  over several apps, or how Oscar can be combined with other solutions.
* ``howto/`` contains tutorial-style descriptions on how to solve a certain
  problem. Ideally, those will be kept to a minimum; as the other docs should
  be understandable enough that necessary steps to achieve a certain goal are
  obvious.
* ``_old/`` contains legacy documents that have not been moved into the new
  structure. Please help get rid of those!

``/index.rst`` is designed as the entry point, and diverges from above
structure to make the documentation more approachable. Other ``index.rst``
files should only be created if there's too many files to list them all.
E.g. ``/index.rst`` directly links to all files in ``topics/`` and
``internals/``, but there's an ``index.rst`` both for the files in ``howto/``
and ``ref/apps/``.


Conventions
===========

General
-------

* PEP8 everywhere while remaining sensible

URLs
----

* List pages should use plurals; e.g. ``/products/``, ``/notifications/``

* Detail pages should simply be a PK/slug on top of the list page; e.g.
  ``/products/the-bible/``, ``/notifications/1/``
  
* Create pages should have 'create' as the final path segment; e.g.
  ``/dashboard/notifications/create/``

* Update pages are sometimes the same as detail pages (i.e., when in the
  dashboard).  In those cases, just use the detail convention, eg
  ``/dashboard/notifications/3/``.  If there is a distinction between the detail
  page and the update page, use ``/dashboard/notifications/3/update/``.

* Delete pages; e.g., ``/dashboard/notifications/3/delete/``

View class names
----------------

Classes should be named according to::

    '%s%sView' % (class_name, verb)

For example, ``ProductUpdateView``, ``OfferCreateView`` and
``PromotionDeleteView``.  This doesn't fit all situations, but it's a good basis.
