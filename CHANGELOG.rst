0.4 - 2012-10-19
----------------

Quite a big release this one.  Several new features have been added since the
0.3 release series:

* Better support for digital products.  Additional fields added to product class
  model.
* HTML editing within the dashboard
* A new email dashboard
* Major refactor of the offers module and test suite  
* Product stock alerts: customers can request an alert when when a product comes
  back into stock
* Customer notifications: an API and inbox for sending users notifications

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

Four apps have new migrations.  If you subclass these apps in your project, you
will need to create a new schema migration for each to pick up the upstream
changes.

* Basket: 
  
  - A ``price_excl_tax`` has been added to ``basket.Line``.  This is
    useful for applications that use dynamic pricing where both the price with and
    without tax needs to be stored. 

* Catalogue:

  - A ``requires_shipping`` field has been added to ``catalogue.ProductClass``
    to facilitate better support for digital products (that don't require
    shipping).

  - The ``code`` field of ``catalogue.Option`` now has a unique index.

* Customer: 

  - New models for stock alerts and notifications
  - The ``email_subject_template`` field from
    ``customer.CommunicationEventType`` is now nullable.

* Order:

  - An ``offer_name`` field has been added to ``order.OrderDiscount`` so retain
    audit information on discounts after offers are deleted.

Please ask on the mailing list if any other problems are encountered.

Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

There are 3 new migrations in the catalogue app.  If you have a local version,
you will need to run::

    ./manage.py schemamigration catalogue --auto

to pick up the changes in Oscar's catalogue app.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new setting ``OSCAR_MAIN_TEMPLATE_DIR`` has been introduced
as the template structure has been altered.  This requires your
``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` setting to be altered to include this folder, eg::

    from oscar import OSCAR_MAIN_TEMPLATE_DIR
    TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
        location('templates'),
        OSCAR_MAIN_TEMPLATE_DIR
    )

If you want to extend one of Oscar's templates, then use::

    # base.html
    {% extends 'oscar/base.html' %}

instead of::

    # base.html
    {% extends 'templates/base.html' %}

0.2.2 - 13 July 2012
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixes a bug with applying absolute-discount benefits


0.2.1 - 09 July 2012
--------------------

Mainly small bug-fixes to templates and javascript.  

0.2 - 01 June 2012
------------------

Many components have been rewritten since 0.1 - Oscar is much more of a complete
package now.  New features include:

* Dashboard for managing catalogue, offers, stock, vouchers and more.  This includes
  statistics pages to track performance.

* Sample templates, CSS and JS to get a shop up and running in a minutes.  

* Updated documentation.

* Reworking of shipping methods.

* Automatic up-selling on the basket page.  We now inform the user if they
  partially qualify for an offer.

The documentation still needs more work which we'll do over the next week or
two.

0.1
---

* Initial release - used in production by two major applications at Tangent but
  still quite rough around the edges.  Many features were implemented directly
  in the applications rather than using a feature from oscar.

* Docs are a bit stale and need updating in 0.2
