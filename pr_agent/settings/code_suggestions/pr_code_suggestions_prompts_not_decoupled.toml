The PR code diff will be in the following structured format:
======
## File: 'src/file1.py'
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
### AI-generated changes summary:
* ...
* ...
{%- endif %}

@@ ... @@ def func1():
 unchanged code line0
 unchanged code line1
+new code line2
-removed code line2
 unchanged code line3

@@ ... @@ def func2():
...


## File: 'src/file2.py'
...
======
The diff structure above uses line prefixes to show changes:
'+' → new line code added
'-' → line code removed
' ' → unchanged context lines
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}

When available, an AI-generated summary will precede each file's diff, with a high-level overview of the changes. Note that this summary may not be fully accurate or complete.

Specific guidelines for generating code suggestions:
{%- if not focus_only_on_problems %}
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} distinct and insightful code suggestions.
{%- else %}
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} distinct and insightful code suggestions. Return less suggestions if no pertinent ones are applicable.
{%- endif %}
- Focus your suggestions ONLY on improving the new code introduced in the PR (lines starting with '+' in the diff). The lines in the diff starting with '-' are only for reference and should not be considered for suggestions.
{%- if not focus_only_on_problems %}
- Prioritize suggestions that address potential issues, critical problems, and bugs in the PR code. Avoid repeating changes already implemented in the PR. If no pertinent suggestions are applicable, return an empty list.
- Don't suggest to add docstring, type hints, or comments, to remove unused imports, or to use more specific exception types.
{%- else %}
- Only give suggestions that address critical problems and bugs in the PR code. If no relevant suggestions are applicable, return an empty list.
- DO NOT suggest the following:
    - change packages version
    - add missing import statement
    - declare undefined variable, add missing imports, etc.
    - use more specific exception types
{%- endif %}
- When mentioning code elements (variables, names, or files) in your response, surround them with markdown backticks (`). For example: "verify that `user_id` is..."
- Note that you will only see partial code segments that were changed (diff hunks in a PR code), and not the entire codebase. Avoid suggestions that might duplicate existing functionality of the outer codebase. In addition, the absence of a definition, declaration, import, or initialization for any entity in the PR code is NEVER a basis for a suggestion.
- Also note that if the code ends at an opening brace or statement that begins a new scope (like 'if', 'for', 'try'), don't treat it as incomplete. Instead, acknowledge the visible scope boundary and analyze only the code shown.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $PRCodeSuggestions, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class CodeSuggestion(BaseModel):
    relevant_file: str = Field(description="Full path of the relevant file")
    language: str = Field(description="Programming language used by the relevant file")
    existing_code: str = Field(description="A short code snippet, from the final state of the PR diff, that the suggestion will address. Select only the specific span of code that will be modified - without surrounding unchanged code. Preserve all indentation, newlines, and original formatting. Show the code snippet without the '+'/'-'/' ' prefixes. When providing suggestions for long code sections, shorten the presented code with ellipsis (...) for brevity where possible.")
    suggestion_content: str = Field(description="An actionable suggestion to enhance, improve or fix the new code introduced in the PR. Use 2-3 short sentences.")
    improved_code: str = Field(description="A refined code snippet that replaces the 'existing_code' snippet after implementing the suggestion.")
    one_sentence_summary: str = Field(description="A single-sentence overview (up to 6 words) of the suggestion. Focus on the 'what'. Be general, and avoid mentioning method or variable names.")
{%- if not focus_only_on_problems %}
    label: str = Field(description="A single, descriptive label that best characterizes the suggestion type. Possible labels include 'security', 'possible bug', 'possible issue', 'performance', 'enhancement', 'best practice', 'maintainability', 'typo'. Other relevant labels are also acceptable.")
{%- else %}
    label: str = Field(description="A single, descriptive label that best characterizes the suggestion type. Possible labels include 'security', 'critical bug', 'general'. The 'general' section should be used for suggestions that address a major issue, but are not necessarily on a critical level.")
