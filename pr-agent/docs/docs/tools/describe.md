## Overview

The `describe` tool scans the PR code changes, and generates a description for the PR - title, type, summary, walkthrough and labels.

The tool can be triggered automatically every time a new PR is [opened](../usage-guide/automations_and_usage.md#github-app-automatic-tools-when-a-new-pr-is-opened), or it can be invoked manually by commenting on any PR:

```
/describe
```

## Example usage

### Manual triggering

Invoke the tool manually by commenting `/describe` on any PR:

![Describe comment](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/describe_comment.png){width=512}

After ~30 seconds, the tool will generate a description for the PR:

![Describe New](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/describe_new.png){width=512}

If you want to edit [configurations](#configuration-options), add the relevant ones to the command:

```
/describe --pr_description.some_config1=... --pr_description.some_config2=...
```

### Automatic triggering

To run the `describe` automatically when a PR is opened, define in a [configuration file](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/usage-guide/configuration_options/#wiki-configuration-file):

```
[github_app]
pr_commands = [
    "/describe",
    ...
]

[pr_description]
publish_labels = true
...
```

- The `pr_commands` lists commands that will be executed automatically when a PR is opened.
- The `[pr_description]` section contains the configurations for the `describe` tool you want to edit (if any).

## Preserving the original user description

By default, Qodo Merge tries to preserve your original PR description by placing it above the generated content.
This requires including your description during the initial PR creation.

"Qodo removed the original description from the PR. Why"?

From our experience, there are two possible reasons:

- If you edit the description _while_ the automated tool is running, a race condition may occur, potentially causing your original description to be lost. Hence, create a description before launching the PR.

- When _updating_ PR descriptions, the `/describe` tool considers everything above the "PR Type" field as user content and will preserve it.
Everything below this marker is treated as previously auto-generated content and will be replaced.

## Sequence Diagram Support 
The `/describe` tool includes a Mermaid sequence diagram showing component/function interactions. 

This option is enabled by default via the `pr_description.enable_pr_diagram` param.

## Inline file summary 💎

This feature enables you to copy the `changes walkthrough` table to the "Files changed" tab, so you can quickly understand the changes in each file while reviewing the code changes (diff view).

To copy the `changes walkthrough` table to the "Files changed" tab, you can click on the checkbox that appears PR Description status message below the main PR Description:

![Add table checkbox](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/add_table_checkbox.png){width=512}

If you prefer to have the file summaries appear in the "Files changed" tab on every PR, change the `pr_description.inline_file_summary` parameter in the configuration file, possible values are:

- `'table'`: File changes walkthrough table will be displayed on the top of the "Files changed" tab, in addition to the "Conversation" tab.

![Diffview table](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/diffview-table.png){width=512}

- `true`: A collapsible file comment with changes title and a changes summary for each file in the PR.

![Diffview changes](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/diffview_changes.png){width=512}

- `false` (`default`): File changes walkthrough will be added only to the "Conversation" tab.

**Note**: that this feature is currently available only for GitHub.

## Markers template

To enable markers, set `pr_description.use_description_markers=true`.
Markers enable to easily integrate user's content and auto-generated content, with a template-like mechanism.

For example, if the PR original description was:

```
User content...

## PR Type:
pr_agent:type

## PR Description:
pr_agent:summary

## PR Walkthrough:
pr_agent:walkthrough

## PR Diagram:
pr_agent:diagram
```

The marker `pr_agent:type` will be replaced with the PR type, `pr_agent:summary` will be replaced with the PR summary, `pr_agent:walkthrough` will be replaced with the PR walkthrough, and `pr_agent:diagram` will be replaced with the sequence diagram (if enabled).

![Describe markers before](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/describe_markers_before.png){width=512}

becomes

![Describe markers after](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/describe_markers_after.png){width=512}

**Configuration params**:

- `use_description_markers`: if set to true, the tool will use markers template. It replaces every marker of the form `pr_agent:marker_name` with the relevant content. Default is false.
- `include_generated_by_header`: if set to true, the tool will add a dedicated header: 'Generated by PR Agent at ...' to any automatic content. Default is true.
- `diagram`: if present as a marker, will be replaced by the PR sequence diagram (if enabled).

## Custom labels

The default labels of the describe tool are quite generic, since they are meant to be used in any repo: [`Bug fix`, `Tests`, `Enhancement`, `Documentation`, `Other`].

You can define custom labels that are relevant for your repo and use cases.
Custom labels can be defined in a [configuration file](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/tools/custom_labels/#configuration-options), or directly in the repo's [labels page](#handle-custom-labels-from-the-repos-labels-page).

Make sure to provide proper title, and a detailed and well-phrased description for each label, so the tool will know when to suggest it.
Each label description should be a **conditional statement**, that indicates if to add the label to the PR or not, according to the PR content.

???+ tip "Auto-remove custom label when no longer relevant"
    If the custom label is no longer relevant, it will be automatically removed from the PR by running the `generate_labels` tool or the `describe` tool.


### Handle custom labels from a configuration file

Example for a custom labels configuration setup in a configuration file:

```
[config]
enable_custom_labels=true


[custom_labels."sql_changes"]
description = "Use when a PR contains changes to SQL queries"

[custom_labels."test"]
description = "use when a PR primarily contains new tests"

...
```

### Handle custom labels from the Repo's labels page 💎

You can also control the custom labels that will be suggested by the `describe` tool from the repo's labels page:

- GitHub : go to `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/labels` (or click on the "Labels" tab in the issues or PRs page)
- GitLab : go to `https://gitlab.com/{owner}/{repo}/-/labels` (or click on "Manage" -> "Labels" on the left menu)

Now add/edit the custom labels. they should be formatted as follows:

- Label name: The name of the custom label.
- Description: Start the description of with prefix `pr_agent:`, for example: `pr_agent: Description of when AI should suggest this label`.<br>

Examples for custom labels:

- `Main topic:performance` -  pr_agent:The main topic of this PR is performance
- `New endpoint` -  pr_agent:A new endpoint was added in this PR
- `SQL query` -  pr_agent:A new SQL query was added in this PR
- `Dockerfile changes` - pr_agent:The PR contains changes in the Dockerfile
- ...

The description should be comprehensive and detailed, indicating when to add the desired label. For example:
![Add native custom labels](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/add_native_custom_labels.png){width=768}

## Usage Tips

!!! tip "Automation"
    - When you first install Qodo Merge app, the [default mode](../usage-guide/automations_and_usage.md#github-app) for the describe tool is:
    ```
    pr_commands = ["/describe", ...]
    ```
    meaning the `describe` tool will run automatically on every PR, with the default configurations.

- Markers are an alternative way to control the generated description, to give maximal control to the user. If you set:

   ```
   pr_commands = ["/describe --pr_description.use_description_markers=true", ...]
   ```

   the tool will replace every marker of the form `pr_agent:marker_name` in the PR description with the relevant content, where `marker_name` is one of the following:
         *`type`: the PR type.
         * `summary`: the PR summary.
         * `walkthrough`: the PR walkthrough.

- Note that when markers are enabled, if the original PR description does not contain any markers, the tool will not alter the description at all.
