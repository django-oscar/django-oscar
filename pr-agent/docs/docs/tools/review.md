## Overview

The `review` tool scans the PR code changes, and generates feedback about the PR, aiming to aid the reviewing process.
<br>
The tool can be triggered automatically every time a new PR is [opened](../usage-guide/automations_and_usage.md#github-app-automatic-tools-when-a-new-pr-is-opened), or can be invoked manually by commenting on any PR:

```
/review
```

Note that the main purpose of the `review` tool is to provide the **PR reviewer** with useful feedback and insights. The PR author, in contrast, may prefer to save time and focus on the output of the [improve](./improve.md) tool, which provides actionable code suggestions.

(Read more about the different personas in the PR process and how Qodo Merge aims to assist them in our [blog](https://www.codium.ai/blog/understanding-the-challenges-and-pain-points-of-the-pull-request-cycle/))

## Example usage

### Manual triggering

Invoke the tool manually by commenting `/review` on any PR:

![review comment](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/review_comment.png){width=512}

After ~30 seconds, the tool will generate a review for the PR:

![review](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/review3.png){width=512}

If you want to edit [configurations](#configuration-options), add the relevant ones to the command:

```
/review --pr_reviewer.some_config1=... --pr_reviewer.some_config2=...
```

### Automatic triggering

To run the `review` automatically when a PR is opened, define in a [configuration file](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/usage-guide/configuration_options/#wiki-configuration-file):

```
[github_app]
pr_commands = [
    "/review",
    ...
]

[pr_reviewer]
extra_instructions = "..."
...
```

- The `pr_commands` lists commands that will be executed automatically when a PR is opened.
- The `[pr_reviewer]` section contains the configurations for the `review` tool you want to edit (if any).

## Usage Tips

### General guidelines

!!! tip ""

    The `review` tool provides a collection of configurable feedbacks about a PR.
    It is recommended to review the [Configuration options](#configuration-options) section, and choose the relevant options for your use case.

    Some of the features that are disabled by default are quite useful, and should be considered for enabling. For example:
    `require_score_review`, and more.

    On the other hand, if you find one of the enabled features to be irrelevant for your use case, disable it. No default configuration can fit all use cases.

### Automation

!!! tip ""
    When you first install Qodo Merge app, the [default mode](../usage-guide/automations_and_usage.md#github-app-automatic-tools-when-a-new-pr-is-opened) for the `review` tool is:
    ```
    pr_commands = ["/review", ...]
    ```
    Meaning the `review` tool will run automatically on every PR, without any additional configurations.
    Edit this field to enable/disable the tool, or to change the configurations used.

### Auto-generated PR labels by the Review Tool

!!! tip ""

    The `review` can tool automatically add labels to your Pull Requests:

    - **`possible security issue`**: This label is applied if the tool detects a potential [security vulnerability](https://github.com/qodo-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/settings/pr_reviewer_prompts.toml#L103) in the PR's code. This feedback is controlled by the 'enable_review_labels_security' flag (default is true).
    - **`review effort [x/5]`**: This label estimates the [effort](https://github.com/qodo-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/settings/pr_reviewer_prompts.toml#L90) required to review the PR on a relative scale of 1 to 5, where 'x' represents the assessed effort. This feedback is controlled by the 'enable_review_labels_effort' flag (default is true).
    - **`ticket compliance`**: Adds a label indicating code compliance level ("Fully compliant" | "PR Code Verified" | "Partially compliant" | "Not compliant") to any GitHub/Jira/Linea ticket linked in the PR. Controlled by the 'require_ticket_labels' flag (default: false). If 'require_no_ticket_labels' is also enabled, PRs without ticket links will receive a "No ticket found" label.


### Auto-blocking PRs from being merged based on the generated labels

!!! tip ""

    You can configure a CI/CD Action to prevent merging PRs with specific labels. For example, implement a dedicated [GitHub Action](https://medium.com/sequra-tech/quick-tip-block-pull-request-merge-using-labels-6cc326936221).

    This approach helps ensure PRs with potential security issues or ticket compliance problems will not be merged without further review.

    Since AI may make mistakes or lack complete context, use this feature judiciously. For flexibility, users with appropriate permissions can remove generated labels when necessary. When a label is removed, this action will be automatically documented in the PR discussion, clearly indicating it was a deliberate override by an authorized user to allow the merge.

### Extra instructions

!!! tip "" 

    Extra instructions are important.
    The `review` tool can be configured with extra instructions, which can be used to guide the model to a feedback tailored to the needs of your project.

    Be specific, clear, and concise in the instructions. With extra instructions, you are the prompter. Specify the relevant sub-tool, and the relevant aspects of the PR that you want to emphasize.

    Examples of extra instructions:
    ```
    [pr_reviewer]
    extra_instructions="""\
    In the code feedback section, emphasize the following:
    - Does the code logic cover relevant edge cases?
    - Is the code logic clear and easy to understand?
    - Is the code logic efficient?
    ...
    """
    ```
    Use triple quotes to write multi-line instructions. Use bullet points to make the instructions more readable.
