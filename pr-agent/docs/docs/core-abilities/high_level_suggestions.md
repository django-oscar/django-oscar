# High-level Suggestions 💎

`Supported Git Platforms: GitHub, GitLab`

## Overview
High-level Suggestions, generated by the `improve` tool, offer big-picture code suggestions for your pull request. They focus on broader improvements rather than local fixes, and provide before-and-after code snippets to illustrate the recommended changes and guide implementation.
