Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. _new_in_2.1:

What's new in Oscar 2.1?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The database performance of ``offer.Range.all_products()`` was substantially
  improved. The internals of that method have changed and specifically
  ``Range.invalidate_cached_ids()`` has been removed and replaced with
  ``Range.invalidate_cached_queryset()``.

- The ``upload_to`` argument of image fields in Oscar's ``ProductImage`` and
  ``ProductAttributeValue`` models was changed to use a callable, so that
  Django doesn't generate migrations if a project modifies the ``OSCAR_IMAGE_FOLDER``
  to specify a custom directory structure for uploaded images.


Removal of deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``OrderPlacementMixin.place_order`` now ignores inactive vouchers when placing
  an order (instead of raising an exception), for consistency with how
  the basket flows handle inactive vouchers.


Dependency changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgraded ``django-phonenumber-field`` to use the latest in the 3.x series.
- Upgraded ``select2`` to version 4.0.10.
- Upgraded ``inputmask`` to version 4.0.8.
