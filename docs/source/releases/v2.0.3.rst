Oscar 2.0.3 release notes
=======================

:release: 2019-10-08

This is Oscar 2.0.3, a bugfix release.

Bug fixes
=========

- Added an ``OSCAR_THUMBNAIL_DEBUG`` setting to control whether the
  ``oscar_thumbnail`` template tag raises exceptions. This fixes a regression in
  Oscar 2 where thumbnailing errors resulted in exceptions being propagated,
  contrary to Django's recommendations that template tags should never
  raise exceptions.
