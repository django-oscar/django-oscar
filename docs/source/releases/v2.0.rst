What's new in Oscar 2.0?
------------------------

Removal of deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for deprecated product alert email templates was removed The templates
  for these emails have been replaced as follows:

    - ``customer/alerts/emails/confirmation_subject.txt`` is replaced by
      ``customer/emails/commtype_product_alert_confirmation_subject.txt``
    - ``customer/alerts/emails/confirmation_body.txt`` is replaced by
      ``customer/emails/commtype_product_alert_confirmation_body.txt``
    - ``customer/alerts/emails/alert_subject.txt`` is replaced by
      ``customer/emails/commtype_product_alert_subject.txt``
    - ``customer/alerts/emails/alert_body.txt`` is replaced by
      ``customer/emails/commtype_product_alert_body.txt``

  Product alert emails are now sent as Communication Events.

- Support for category URLs without a primary key was removed.

  Enforcement of unique slugs for categories was also removed, as enforcing
  this was inefficient and not threadsafe. Since a primary key is now required
  for category URLs, there is no need for slugs to be unique.

Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Dropped ``action=""`` and ``action="."`` attributes, following the lead of Django
   and as per the HTML5 specification.

- Replaced use of Django's procedural auth views with the corresponding
  class-based views.

- ``OrderPlacementMixin.get_message_context()`` is now passed a ``code`` argument
  specifying the communication event type code for a message being sent.
