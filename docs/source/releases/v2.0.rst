Compatibility
-------------

Oscar 2.0 is compatible with Django 1.11, Django 2.0 and Django 2.1 as well as
Python 3.5 and 3.6.

Support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 has been dropped.

.. _new_in_2.0:

What's new in Oscar 2.0?
------------------------

- Added an ``order.OrderStatusChange`` model that is used to log order status changes
  applied by ``Order.set_status()``. This is a new model which will require database migrations to be applied.

- Added an ``OSCAR_OFFERS_INCL_TAX`` setting which can be used to configure whether
  offer discounts are applied on the tax-inclusive amount. This defaults to ``False``,
  to preserve the original behaviour of discount application.

- Added database index definitions for commonly queried fields in a range of models. See `#2875`_.
  This will require projects that have forked Oscar apps to generate corresponding migrations.

Removal of deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for deprecated product alert email templates was removed The templates
  for these emails have been replaced as follows:

    - ``customer/alerts/emails/confirmation_subject.txt`` is replaced by
      ``customer/emails/commtype_product_alert_confirmation_subject.txt``
    - ``customer/alerts/emails/confirmation_body.txt`` is replaced by
      ``customer/emails/commtype_product_alert_confirmation_body.txt``
    - ``customer/alerts/emails/alert_subject.txt`` is replaced by
      ``customer/emails/commtype_product_alert_subject.txt``
    - ``customer/alerts/emails/alert_body.txt`` is replaced by
      ``customer/emails/commtype_product_alert_body.txt``

  Product alert emails are now sent as Communication Events.

- Support for category URLs without a primary key was removed.

  Enforcement of unique slugs for categories was also removed, as enforcing
  this was inefficient and not threadsafe. Since a primary key is now required
  for category URLs, there is no need for slugs to be unique.

- ``customer.forms.SetPasswordForm`` and ``customer.forms.PasswordChangeForm``
  have been removed. Use ``django.contrib.auth.forms.SetPasswordForm`` and
  ``django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordChangeForm`` instead.

- The ``views.decorators.staff_member_required`` decorator has been removed. Use
  ``permissions_required(['is_staff']`` instead.

- The ``UserAddress.num_orders`` property has been removed. Use
  ``num_orders_as_shipping_address`` and ``num_orders_as_billing_address``
  instead.

- Backward-compatible dynamic loading of formset classes that have moved in Oscar was
  removed. Projects must update their ``get_class`` calls to use the new paths.

  The paths that have changed are as follows:

  ================================  ==================================  ================
  Old path                          New path                            Affected classes

                                                                        ``BaseSavedLineFormSet``

                                                                        ``BaseProductImageFormSet``

                                                                        ``ProductImageFormSet``

                                                                        ``BaseProductRecommendationFormSet``

                                                                        ``ProductRecommendationFormSet``

                                                                        ``ProductAttributesFormSet``

  ``wishlists.forms``               ``wishlists.formsets``              ``LineFormset``
  ================================  ==================================  ================

- Added the ability to manage ``catalogue.Option`` objects from the dashboard.

Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Dropped ``action=""`` and ``action="."`` attributes, following the lead of Django
  and as per the HTML5 specification.

- Replaced use of Django's procedural auth views with the corresponding
  class-based views.

- ``OrderPlacementMixin.get_message_context()`` is now passed a ``code`` argument
  specifying the communication event type code for a message being sent.

- We've dropped the dependency on Unidecode due to license incompatibilities,
  ``oscar.core.utils.default_slugifier`` now uses ``oscar.core.utils.cautious_slugify``
  to handle unicode characters in slugs when ``OSCAR_SLUG_ALLOW_UNICODE`` is ``False``.

- ``OSCAR_SLUG_FUNCTION`` previously accepted a function as its value. It now
  only accepts a dotted path to a function as its value. Such functions must
  also now take a ``allow_unicode`` kwarg.

- Fixed input validation for ``dashboard.offers.forms.BenefitForm`` when a ``range``
  was specified but other fields were empty.

- Fixed calculation of weight-based shipping charges in cases where the basket
  weight is an exact multiple of a weight band's upper limit.

- The ``sort_by`` field on ``catalogue.reviews.SortReviewsForm`` was made optional
  and the logic in ``ProductReviewList`` adjusted so that the form fields
  don't have to be rendered manually because of form errors.

- Added a ``datetime_filters`` tag library that provides a ``timedelta`` template
  filter for rendering time deltas in human readable format.

- ``OSCAR_OFFER_ROUNDING_FUNCTION`` previously accepted a function as its value. It now
  only accepts a dotted path to a function as its value

- Fixed the logic of ``offers.Range.all_products()`` to make it consistent with
  ``Range.contains_product()`` in excluding products specified in ``excluded_product_ids``.

- Added a ``COMPARISON_FIELDS`` constant to ``catalogue.Category`` to restrict
  which fields are fetched from the database when performing category comparison queries.

.. _incompatible_in_2.0:

Backwards incompatible changes in Oscar 2.0
-------------------------------------------

- Redirection to the parent detail view for child products is disabled by default.
  Child products now have their own detail view, which allows displaying their price
  and images independently from the parent product. To revert to the previous behaviour
  of redirecting to the parent product, set
  ``oscar.apps.catalogue.views.ProductDetailView.enforce_parent`` to ``False``.

Dependency changes
------------------

- Upgraded TinyMCE to version 4.8.3.

- Upgraded jQuery inputmask to version 4.0.2.

.. _deprecated_features_in_2.0:

Deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``offer.Range.contains()`` is deprecated. Use ``contains_product()`` instead.

- ``catalogue.managers.ProductManager`` is deprecated.
  Use ``catalogue.managers.ProductQuerySet.as_manager()`` instead.

- ``catalogue.managers.BrowsableProductManager`` is deprecated.
  Use ``Product.objects.browsable()`` instead.
