.. _compatibility_of_3.2:

Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oscar 3.2 is compatible with Django 3.1 and Django 3.2 and Python versions 3.7 to 3.9.

Support for Django 2.2 has been dropped. Support for Python 3.6 has been dropped.

.. _new_in_3.2:

What's new in Oscar 3.2?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Pass request to all the messages so we can get the actual site to use in email messages.

- ``oscar.order.mixins.EventHandlerMixin`` was created for easily using the EventHandler without manually create the handler every time.

.. _backwards_incompatible_in_3.2:

Backwards incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The interface for the OPTION_FIELD_FACTORIES has changed and now receives the
  form, the product and the option. Update your overrides as required.


.. _removal_of_deprecated_features_in_3.2:

Removal of deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme`` is no longer present in ``oscar.core.compat`` and should be directly imported as ``django.utils.http.url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme``

.. _minor_changes_in_3.2:

Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a new helper ``core.utils.is_ajax`` which replicates the logic of Django's ``HttpRequest.is_ajax``
  method that was deprecated in Django 3.1.
  
- Persisted ``OrderFactory.date_placed`` to the database when set, instead of just setting it on the object without saving it.

- Fixed getting non public categories with ``get_categories`` by only returning browsable categories.

- Reviews can now only be viewed and placed when the product is public.

- The title has been removed by default from all address forms in Oscar. The database field is still present, and projects that wish to retain this field in their forms should add it back by overriding the fields property of the Meta    class for applicable forms.

- Changed ``PartnerProductFilterMixin`` queryset to also include child products for the partner user.

- Changed ``RangeDetailView`` to respect the ``OSCAR_PRODUCTS_PER_PAGE`` setting for pagination.

- Fixed the output of the ``OfferReportGenerator`` and generated it's data more efficiently.

- Avoid ``KeyError`` in ``BulkEditMixin`` if objects matching filters no longer exist.

- Changed the order of ``check_skip_conditions`` and ``check_pre_conditions``.

- Made it easier to pass custom arguments to order processing ``EventHandler``.

- Fixed the handling of ``InvalidPage`` exceptions in ``CatalogueView``.

- Added ``search_fields`` to ``AbstractAddress`` model.


.. _dependency_changes_in_3.2:

Dependency changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python package dependencies:


Javascript and CSS dependencies:

- Upgraded ``@fortawesome/fontawesome-free`` to version 5.15.4.
- Upgraded ``bootstrap`` to version 4.6.1.
- Upgraded ``inputmask`` to version 5.0.7.
- Upgraded ``tinymce`` to version 5.10.2.


Deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``annotate_form_field`` template tag is deprecated. It's functionality of annotating form fields with
  their widget type is now built in to Django.

- In the ORDER_PLACED email templates, the variable ``status_url`` should not be used anymore. Please use
  ``status_path`` in conjunction with the ``absolute_url`` template tag instead. It will be removed in a future
  version of Oscar.
