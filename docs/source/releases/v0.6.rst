Oscar 0.6 release notes
=======================

Welcome to Oscar 0.6!

These release notes cover the `new features`_ as well as `backwards incompatible changes`_ 
that you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from Oscar 0.5 or
earlier.  This release contains some major changes to core APIs which means
many old APIs are to be dropped - see the `deprecation plan`_.

To upgrade your Oscar site, make sure you study both the `backwards incompatible changes`_ 
and the `deprecated features`_

Overview
========

The biggest change in Oscar 0.6 is the reworking of `pricing and availability`_, which 
builds on top of the change to allow `multiple stockrecords per product`_.  The
charge is largely backwards compatible with the old system of "partner
wrappers" but it is recommended to upgrade to the new system.

Oscar now supports Django 1.5 and its custom user model.  This has been only
tested in the context of starting a new Oscar project with a custom model.
Switching from a separate "profile" model to the new system is not recommended
at this point.

Other notable new features include:

* A feature-rich demo site that illustrates how Oscar can be customised.  It
  also uses several of Oscar's many extensions, such as django-oscar-paypal_,
  django-oscar-datacash_ and django-oscar-stores_.

* Partners can now have addresses.

What's new in Oscar 0.6?
========================

Multiple stockrecords per product
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Products can now have multiple stockrecords rather than just one.  This allows a
product to be fulfilled by one of several partners.  This is a key requirement
for large-scale e-commerce sites selling millions of products, that use many
different fulfillment partners.

Pricing and availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When products can have many stockrecords, a process needs to be in place to
choose which one is selected for a given customer and product.  To handle this,
a new "strategy" class has been introduced which selects the appropriate
stockrecord for a given customer and product.

This change also paved the way for reworking how prices, taxes and availability
are handled.  Instead of using `"partner wrappers"`_, the strategy class is
responsible for returning availability details and prices for a particular
product.  New classes known as pricing and availabiliy policies are used to
encapsulate this information.

These changes allows Oscar to support many advanced scenarios such as:

* Fulfilling a product from the partner that offers the best margin.
* Fulfilling a product from the partner geographically closest to the customer.
* Supporting transactions in multiple currencies on the same site.
* Supporting different tax treatments on the same site (eg UK VAT and US sales
  tax)
* Having different pricing policies for different customers. 

There's a great deal of flexibility.

Payment models have abstract versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The payment models have been split into abstract- and concrete versions.  This
brings them inline with other Oscar apps and allows them to be customised.

Multi-partner dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Partners can now have addresses.  These are useful for US sales tax where tax
calculations need to know the origin of a product being shipped.  The dashboard
has been extended to allow partner addresses to be edited.

Demo site
~~~~~~~~~

Oscar now ships with a demo site along side the sandbox site.  While the sandbox
is a minimal Django project that uses Oscar with all its defaults, the demo site
is a more realistic example of an Oscar project.  It has a custom skin and makes
many alterations to the default Oscar behaviour.  

It's features include:

* A range of different product types: books, downloads, clothing
* PayPal Express integration using django-oscar-paypal_
* Datacash integration using django-oscar-datacash_

.. _django-oscar-paypal: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar-paypal
.. _django-oscar-datacash: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar-datacash
.. _django-oscar-stores: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar-stores

* :doc:`The demo site </internals/sandbox>`.

Django 1.5 and custom user model support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oscar now supports `custom user models`_, the headline new feature in Django
1.5.  These can be used standalone or with a one-to-one profile model: Oscar's
account forms inspect the model fields to dynamically pick up the fields for
editing and display.

There are some restrictions on what fields a custom user model must have.  For
instance, Oscar's default auth backend requires the user model to have an email
and password field.  New Oscar projects are encouraged to use the provided
abstract user model as the base for their users.

.. _`documentation on user models`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#specifying-a-custom-user-model

Accounts 
~~~~~~~~

The views and templates of the accounts section have been reworked to be clearer
and easier to extend.

Better bankcard handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bankcard model in the payment app has been greatly improved.

Order processing changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are changes to order processing methods

Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* detox_ is a new dependency, which allows running `tox` tests in parallel.

Backwards incompatible changes in 0.6
=====================================

Signature changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several classes and functions have had signature changes:

* The ``basket_form`` templatetag has been altered to take the ``request`` as the
  first argument, not ``request.basket``.

* The :class:`oscar.apps.customer.forms.EmailAuthenticationForm` form needs to
  be instantated with a host name so prevent redirects to external sites.

* The :class:`oscar.apps.customer.forms.EmailAuthenticationForm` form needs to
  be instantated with a host name so prevent redirects to external sites.

* The two product review forms, ``SignedInUserProductReviewForm`` and
  ``AnonymousUserProductReviewForm``, have been replaced by a new
  :class:`oscar.apps.catalogue.reviews.forms.ProductReviewForm``.

Address model changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``UserAddress.salutation`` and ``UserAddress.name`` methods are now
  properties.

* ``Country`` model's `is_highlighted` column is now integer field to allow
  fine-grained country selection. 0 = no highlighting

Renamed templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The template ``customer/email/email.html`` has been renamed to
  ``customer/email/email_detail.html``.

* The template ``customer/orders/order.html`` has been renamed to
  ``customer/orders/order_detail.html``.

Template block changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The template ``dashboard/orders/order_detail.html`` has been reorganised.  The
  ``tab_transactions`` block has been renamed to ``payment_transactions``.

Upgrading notes
===============

Database migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Alternative product class templates now use ``slug` field instead of
  ``name.lower()`` to determine their filename.  If you have templates for
  specific product classes, please update your filenames accordingly

Checkout app:

* Checkout has a new option "Register and continue". Option value `new` in
  `GatewayForm` has changed to `guest` as `new` option is used for this feature.

* Payment details - create_billing_address accepts kwargs so data can be passed
  to it from the final page of checkout.

* The session methods for loading shipping addresses and methods have been made
  explicit.  The relevant basket *has* to be passed in now.

Payment app:

* The `balance` method on the source object is not a property not a method.

URLs
~~~~

The named search URL ``search_default`` is renamed to ``search-default`` for
consistency with the rest of Oscar.

Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

There are new migrations in the following apps to be aware of.

* Catalogue:

    - ``0011``: Higher ``max_length`` on FileFields and ImageFields

* Promotions:

    - ``0003``: Higher ``max_length`` on FileFields and ImageFields

* Address:

    - ``0003``: ``Country``'s ``is_highlighted`` is now an integer to allow
      finer control.

* Order app:

    - The `date` field of the ``order.AbstractCommunicationEvent``, ``order.AbstractPaymentEvent`` and
      ``order.AbstractShippingEvent`` models have been renamed to ``date_created`` for
      consistency with the rest of Oscar.
  

Features deprecated in 0.6
==========================

Accessing a product's stockrecords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several properties and methods of the core
:class:`~oscar.apps.catalogue.abstract_models.AbstractProduct`  class have been
deprecated following the change to allow multiple stockrecords per product. 

* :attr:`~oscar.apps.catalogue.abstract_models.AbstractProduct.has_stockrecord`
  no longer makes sense when there can be more than one stockrecord.  It is
  replaced by
  :attr:`~oscar.apps.catalogue.abstract_models.AbstractProduct.has_stockrecords`

* :attr:`~oscar.apps.catalogue.abstract_models.AbstractProduct.stockrecord` is
  deprecated since it presumes there is only one stockrecord per product.
  Choosing the appropriate stockrecord is now the responsiblity of the 
  :ref:`strategy class <strategy_class>`.  A backward compatible version has
  been kept in place that selects the first stockrecord for a product.  This
  will continue to work for sites that only have one stockrecord per product.

All availability logic has been moved to :ref:`availability policies<availability_policies>` 
which are determined by the :ref:`strategy class <strategy_class>`.

* :attr:`~oscar.apps.catalogue.abstract_models.AbstractProduct.is_available_to_buy` 
  is deprecated.  The functionality is now part of availability policies.

* :meth:`~oscar.apps.catalogue.abstract_models.AbstractProduct.is_purchase_permitted` 
  is deprecated.  The functionality is now part of availability policies.

"Partner wrappers"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before Oscar 0.6, availability and pricing logic was encapsulated in "partner
wrappers".  A partner wrapper was a class that provided availability and price
information for a particular partner, as specified by the
``OSCAR_PARTNER_WRAPPERS`` setting.  The stockrecord model had several
properties and methods
which delegated to the appropriate wrapper for the record's partner.

This functionailty is now deprecated in favour of using :ref:`strategy classes <strategy_class>`.  
How prices and taxes are determined is not generally a function of the partner,
and so this system was not a good model.  Strategy classes are much more
flexible and allow better modelling of taxes and availability.

The following attributes and methods from :class:`~oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.StockRecord` 
are deprecated and will be removed for Oscar 0.7.  

* :attr:`AbstractStockRecord.is_available_to_buy <oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractStockRecord.is_available_to_buy>` 
* :meth:`AbstractStockRecord.is_purchase_permitted <oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractStockRecord.is_purchase_permitted>` 
* :attr:`AbstractStockRecord.availability_code <oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractStockRecord.availability_code>` 
* :attr:`AbstractStockRecord.availability <oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractStockRecord.availability>` 
* :attr:`AbstractStockRecord.max_purchase_quantity <oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractStockRecord.max_purchase_quantity>` 
* :attr:`AbstractStockRecord.dispatch_date <oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractStockRecord.dispatch_date>` 
* :attr:`AbstractStockRecord.lead_time <oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractStockRecord.lead_time>` 
* :attr:`AbstractStockRecord.price_incl_tax <oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractStockRecord.price_incl_tax>` 
* :attr:`AbstractStockRecord.price_tax <oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractStockRecord.price_tax>` 

All the above properties and methods have effectively been moved to the availability and pricing
policies that a strategy class is responsible for loading.  To upgrade your
codebase, replcae your partner wrapper classes with equivalent 
:doc:`availability and pricing policies </topics/prices_and_availability>`.

Basket
~~~~~~~

Now that products can have multiple stockrecords, several changes have been made
to baskets to allow the appropriate stockrecord to be tracked for each basket
line.  The basket line model has a new field that links to the selected
stockrecord and the basket itself requires an instance of the strategy class so
that prices can be calculated for each line.  Hence, if you are manipulating
baskets directly, you need to assign a strategy class in order for prices to
calculate correctly:

.. code-block:: python

    from oscar.apps.basket import models

    basket = models.Basket.objects.get(id=1)
    basket.strategy = request.strategy

With an assigned strategy class, a basket will raise a ``RuntimeError`` when
attempting to calculate totals.

The way a product is added to a basket has also been changed as a ``StockInfo``
instance is also required.  

.. code-block:: python

    from oscar.apps.basket import models
    from oscar.apps.catalogue import models as product_models

    basket = models.Basket.objects.get(id=1)
    basket.strategy = request.strategy
    product = product_models.Product.objects.get(id=1)
    stockinfo = request.strategy.fetch(product)
    
    basket.
