What's new in Oscar 0.6?
========================

The payment models have been split into abstract- and concrete versions.  This
brings them inline with other Oscar apps and allows them to be customised.

Multi-partner dashboard

Demo site
~~~~~~~~~

Oscar now ships with a demo site along side the sandbox site.  While the sandbox
is a minimal Django project that uses Oscar with all its defaults, the demo site
is a more realistic example of an Oscar project.  It has a custom skin and makes
many alterations to the default Oscar behaviour.  

It's features include:

* A range of different product types: books, downloads, clothing
* PayPal Express integration using django-oscar-paypal_
* Datacash integration using django-oscar-datacash_

.. _django-oscar-paypal: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar-paypal
.. _django-oscar-datacash: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar-datacash

Django 1.5 and custom user model support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oscar now supports `custom user models`_, the headline new feature in Django 1.5.  These can be used standalone 
or with a one-to-one profile model: Oscar's account forms inspect the model
fields to dynamically pick up the fields for editing and display.

There are some restrictions on what fields a custom user model must have.  For
instance, Oscar's default auth backend requires the user model to have an email
and password field.  New Oscar projects are encouraged to use the provided
abstract user model as the base for their users.

Accounts 
~~~~~~~~

The views and templates of the accounts section have been reworked to be clearer
and easier to extend.

Better bankcard handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bankcard model in the payment app has been greatly improved.

Order processing changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are changes to order processing methods

Upgrading 
=========

Templatetags:

* The ``basket_form`` templatetag has been altered to take the ``request`` as the
  first argument, not ``request.basket``.

Templates:

* The template ``customer/email/email.html`` has been renamed to
  ``customer/email/email_detail.html``.

* The template ``customer/orders/order.html`` has been renamed to
  ``customer/orders/order_detail.html``.

* The template ``dashboard/orders/order_detail.html`` has been reorganised.  The
  ``tab_transactions`` block has been renamed to ``payment_transactions``.

* Alternative product class templates now use ``slug` field instead of
  ``name.lower()`` to determine their filename.  If you have templates for
  specific product classes, please update your filenames accordingly

Address app:

* The ``UserAddress.salutation`` and ``UserAddress.name`` methods are now
  properties.

* ``Country`` model's `is_highlighted` column is now integer field to allow
  fine-grained country selection. 0 = no highlighting

Checkout app:

* Checkout has a new option "Register and continue". Option value `new` in
  `GatewayForm` has changed to `guest` as `new` option is used for this feature.

Payment app:

* The `balance` method on the source object is not a property not a method.

Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

There are new migrations in the following apps to be aware of.

* Catalogue:

    - ``0011``: Higher ``max_length`` on FileFields and ImageFields

* Promotions:

    - ``0003``: Higher ``max_length`` on FileFields and ImageFields

* Address:

    - ``0003``: ``Country``'s ``is_highlighted`` is now an integer to allow
      finer control.

* Order app:

    - The `date` field of the ``order.AbstractCommunicationEvent``, ``order.AbstractPaymentEvent`` and
      ``order.AbstractShippingEvent`` models have been renamed to ``date_created`` for
      consistency with the rest of Oscar.
