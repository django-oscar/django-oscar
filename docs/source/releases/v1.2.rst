Compatibility
-------------

Oscar 1.2 is compatible with... 


.. _new_in_1.2:

What's new in Oscar 1.2?
------------------------
 - ``django-compressor`` has been removed as a dependency, and as a way
   of building ``less`` files for development. Removing or disabling it
   was commonly required as it didn't work well with deploying on PaaS
   providers, and many current projects understandably prefer to use
   Javascript build chains (``gulp``, ``grunt``, etc.) for all their
   statics.
   But ``django-compressor`` was hard to remove  on a per-project basis,
   so the decision was made to remove it altogether.

   For development, ``USE_LESS`` now enables the browser-based on-the-fly
   pre-processor. ``make css`` continues to run a locally installed
   LESS binary.

.. _minor_changes_in_1.2:

Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Fix missing page_url field in the promotions form (`#1816`_)
 - ``Voucher.date_created`` and ``VoucherApplication.date_created``
   are date fields that have been deprecated.
   Their intended replacements are the new ``.created`` datetime
   fields, which we hope are more generally useful. If you have been happy
   with just having the date, we suggest to keep using the old fields
   for now, and only switch to the new field when ``date_created`` is
   removed as part of Oscar 1.3. But you can always write a data migration
   should it be necessary to keep the old creation dates around.

.. _incompatible_in_1.2:

Backwards incompatible changes in Oscar 1.2
-------------------------------------------

- The ``mainstyles`` template block was removed. It served as a wrapper
  for the ``styles`` content black and was needed to be extensible while
  still being able to compress CSS. As ``django-compressor`` has been
  removed, it's not needed any more. Just use ``styles`` instead if you
  happened to use it.

- The `keywords` block is removed from the main template (`#1799`)

- The US and Demo sites were both removed from the repository as they 
  were not up-to-date anymore. These might return in the future as 
  separate repositories.

- The `RecentReviewsManager`, `TopScoredReviewsManager` and 
  `TopVotedReviewsManager` managers are removed from the reviews app 
  since they were broken and unused.


Misc
