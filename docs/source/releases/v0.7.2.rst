Oscar 0.7.2 release notes
=========================

This is Oscar 0.7.2, a minor security release. If you rely on the
``permissions_required`` decorator or the
``Application.permissions_map`` and ``Application.default_permissions`` syntax,
you must upgrade.

Bug fixes
=========

* The ``permissions_required`` decorator now handles both methods and
  properties on the User model. Previously, it wasn't supported, but a
  docstring showed ``is_anonymous`` as an example, which is a
  method.

* It fixes a syntax error in ``basket.views.BasketView`` when rendering an
  error message. Previously, trying to save an item for later while not
  being logged in would cause an Internal Server Error.
