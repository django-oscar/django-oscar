.. _compatibility_of_1.6:

Compatibility
-------------

Oscar 1.6 is compatible with Django 1.8, 1.10 and 1.11 as well as Python 2.7,
3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6. Support for Django 1.9 is no longer officialy supported
since it is longer supported by Django (end of life).


.. _new_in_1.6:

What's new in Oscar 1.6?
------------------------


Removal of deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Majority of the Oscar imports now using dynamic loading, instead of
   direct importing for better extensibility and customizability, except
   signals.
 - Customer transaction emails reworked on top of mailgun layout and has
   better look.
 - ``SearchHandler.get_search_form`` method now accepts additional
   keyword arguments, which will be passed on search form class instance
   initiation.
 - Added ``get_stock_info`` hook to ``oscar.apps.basket.models.Basket``  for
   implementing strategies that depend on product options.

.. _incompatible_in_1.6:

Backwards incompatible changes in Oscar 1.6
-------------------------------------------

 - ``oscar.apps.customer.auth_backends.EmailBackend`` now rejects inactive users
   (where ``User.is_active`` is ``False``).

 - ``oscar.apps.offer.models.ConditionalOffer`` now has a new flag
   ``exclusive`` to denote that the offer involved can not be combined on the
   same item on the same basket line with another offer.
   This flag is used by ``oscar.apps.basket.utils.LineOfferConsumer``, a facade
   that supercedes the old ``oscar.apps.basket.models.Line._affected_items`` counter,
   and replaces it with a more finegrained approach. This makes it possible to apply
   two distinct non-exclusive offers on the same basketline items, for example
   multiple distinct vouchers.
   A couple of methods on the basketline model have been extended with an
   optional ``offer`` argument, i.e. ``discount`` and ``consume``, so if you
   are using a customized basketline model, you have to update your methods'
   signatures.

 - Invalid URL names supplied to the ``OSCAR_DASHBOARD_NAVIGATION`` setting
   are now logged as an exception (previously they were silently ignored).
   The offending menu item will be skipped during menu rendering.
   In Oscar 1.8 the exception will be raised without being intercepted.

 - All signals are now loaded directly.

Dependency changes
