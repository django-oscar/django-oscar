Backwards incompatible changes in Oscar 1.6
-------------------------------------------

 - ``oscar.apps.offer.models.ConditionalOffer`` now has a new flag
   ``exclusive`` to denote that the offer involved can not be combined on the
   same item on the same basket line with another offer.
   This flag is used by ``oscar.apps.basket.utils.LineOfferConsumer``, a facade 
   that supercedes the old ``oscar.apps.basket.models.Line._affected_items`` counter,
   and replaces it with a more finegrained approach. This makes it possible to apply
   two distinct non-exclusive offers on the same basketline items, for example
   multiple distinct vouchers.
   A couple of methods on the basketline model have been extended with an
   optional ``offer`` argument, i.e. ``discount`` and ``consume``, so if you
   are using a customized basketline model, you have to update your methods'
   signatures.
