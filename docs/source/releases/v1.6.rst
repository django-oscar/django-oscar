What's new in Oscar 1.6?
------------------------


Removal of deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Removed the redundant ``OSCAR_PROMOTION_MERCHANDISING_BLOCK_TYPES`` setting.

Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - The majority of the Oscar class imports now use dynamic loading, instead of
   direct importing, for better extensibility and customizability.

 - Basic HTML email templates added for customer transaction emails.

 - ``SearchHandler.get_search_form`` method now accepts additional
   keyword arguments, which will be passed on search form class instance
   initiation.

 - Added ``get_stock_info`` hook to ``oscar.apps.basket.models.Basket``  for
   implementing strategies that depend on product options.

 - Fixed the page create/update views in the dashboard to correctly validate
   URLs. Invalid characters in URLs will raise a validation error, as will
   URLs longer than 100 characters.

 - The default shipping method ( ``oscar.apps.basket.views.BasketView.get_default_shipping_address``)
   on basket summary page now uses the user's default shipping address to
   calculate an indicative shipping cost.

 - Fixed `ExtendedURLValidator` for locale-prefixed URLs, for locales different
   from the current locale (see :issue:`1481`).

 - Product attribute value save is now handled by separate methods, to make it
   easier to override this behaviour.

 - User notifications are marked as read only when viewed in detail, instead of
   being marked as read in bulk when the notification list was viewed.

 - The Google Analytics tracking code provided by Oscar now uses ``gtag.js`` API
   instead of the deprecated ``analytics.js``.

.. _incompatible_in_1.6:

Backwards incompatible changes in Oscar 1.6
-------------------------------------------

 - ``oscar.apps.customer.auth_backends.EmailBackend`` now rejects inactive users
   (where ``User.is_active`` is ``False``).

 - ``oscar.apps.offer.models.ConditionalOffer`` now has a new flag
   ``exclusive`` to denote that the offer involved can not be combined on the
   same item on the same basket line with another offer.
   This flag is used by ``oscar.apps.basket.utils.LineOfferConsumer``, a facade
   that supercedes the old ``oscar.apps.basket.models.Line._affected_items`` counter,
   and replaces it with a more finegrained approach. This makes it possible to apply
   two distinct non-exclusive offers on the same basketline items, for example
   multiple distinct vouchers.
   A couple of methods on the basketline model have been extended with an
   optional ``offer`` argument, i.e. ``discount`` and ``consume``, so if you
   are using a customized basketline model, you have to update your methods'
   signatures.

 - Invalid URL names supplied to the ``OSCAR_DASHBOARD_NAVIGATION`` setting
   are now logged as an exception (previously they were silently ignored).
   The offending menu item will be skipped during menu rendering.
   In Oscar 1.8 the exception will be raised without being intercepted.

 - All signals are now loaded directly rather than using dynamic imports.

 - Stock manipulation (allocation/consumption/cancellation) now only happens if
   the ``track_stock`` property of the product's class is set to true.

 - jQuery UI was removed from Oscar's static files. Projects that require it
   should install it at the project level.

 - Compatibility for Internet Explorer version 9 an lower was dropped from Oscar's
   templates and styles.

Dependency changes
------------------

- Updated jQuery to version 3.3.1.

- Updated Bootstrap to version 3.3.7.

- Updated bootstrap-datetimepicker to v2.4.4.

- Updated jQuery-mousewheel to v3.1.13.

- Updated inputmask to v3.2.7.

- Updated jquery-sortable to v0.9.13.
