Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Added billing address to user's address book during checkout (:issue:`1532`).
   Number of usages for billing and shipping addresses tracked separately:
   billing address in ``UserAddress.num_orders_as_billing_address`` field and
   shipping address in ``UserAddress.num_order_as_shipping_address``
   accordingly.

 - Fixed logic for determining "hurry mode" on stock alerts. Hurry mode is now
   set if the number of alerts for a product exceeds the quantity in stock,
   rather than the other way around.

 - Updated search to use the haystack CharField instead of the EdgeNgramField
   to fix irrelevant results (:issue:`2128`)

 - Updated ``customer.utils.Dispatcher`` to improve the ability to customise
   the implementation (:issue:`2303`)

 - Fixed logic for determining "hurry mode" on stock alerts. Hurry mode is now
   set if the number of alerts for a product exceeds the quantity in stock,
   rather than the other way around.

 - ``Voucher.date_created`` and ``VoucherApplication.date_created`` model
   fields changed from ``DateField`` to ``DateTimeField``. If you use SQLite
   database, please make sure to backup data before running migrations, since
   due to limited support of column altering, Django re-creates new SQLite
   database with new columns and copies into it original data -
   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/migrations/#sqlite

 - Allowed the communication event dispatcher to accept an optional
   ``mail_connection`` to use when sending email messages.

 - Changed product alerts to be sent using the Communication Event framework.
   The old email templates will continue to be supported until Oscar 2.0.

.. _incompatible_in_1.5:

Backwards incompatible changes in Oscar 1.5
-------------------------------------------

 - Product reviews are now deleted if the associated product is deleted.

 - Formset classes moved to the separate modules, if you import them directly -
   please update location or use :meth:`oscar.core.loading.get_classes` for
   loading classes (:issue:`1957`).

   Next classes have new locations:

  - ``BaseBasketLineFormSet``, ``BasketLineFormSet``, ``BaseSavedLineFormSet``,
    ``SavedLineFormSet`` moved to
    ``oscar.apps.basket.formsets`` module;
  - ``BaseStockRecordFormSet``, ``StockRecordFormSet``,
    ``BaseProductCategoryFormSet``, ``ProductCategoryFormSet``,
    ``BaseProductImageFormSet``, ``ProductImageFormSet``,
    ``BaseProductRecommendationFormSet``, ``ProductRecommendationFormSet``,
    ``ProductAttributesFormSet`` moved to
    ``oscar.apps.dashboard.catalogue.formsets``;
  - ``OrderedProductFormSet`` moved to
    ``oscar.apps.dashboard.promotions.formsets``; - ``LineFormset`` moved to
    ``oscar.apps.wishlists.formsets``.

 - ``SimpleAddToBasketForm`` doesn't override the quantity field any
   more. Instead, it just hides the field declared by AddToBasketForm
   and sets the quantity to one. This means ``SimpleAddToBasketForm``
   doesn't need to be overridden for most cases, but please check
   things still work as expected for you if you have customized it.

 - ``OSCAR_CURRENCY_FORMAT`` setting changed to dictionary form in order to
   support multi-currency for currency formatting. You can set `format`,
   `format_type` and `currency_digits` in it.  Please refer to documentation
   for an example.

 - Dashboard order list doesn't have shortcut filters any more, pass `status`
   parameter instead of `order_status` for the relevant filtering.

 - ``GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`` and ``USE_LESS`` settings were renamed into
   ``OSCAR_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`` and ``OSCAR_USE_LESS`` respectively in order
   to keep all Oscar settings under common namespace.

 - Removed ``display_version`` and ``version`` variables from templates and
   template context.

 - Offer ``Applicator`` is now loaded from the ``offer.applicator`` module,
   instead of ``offer.utils``. Old path is deprecated and won't be supported
   in the next Oscar versions.

 - ``oscar.forms.fields.ExtendedURLField`` no longer accepts a ``verify_exists``
   argument.
