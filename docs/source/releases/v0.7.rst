Compatibility
=============

Oscar 0.7 has experimental support for Python 3. Support for Django 1.4 has
been dropped, and support for Django 1.6 is considered stable.

What's new in Oscar 0.7?
========================

This release is mostly a maintenance release, fixing a lot of bugs and and doing
a lot of housekeeping. We have removed a few unused models and fields, and
removed ``null=True`` on a lot of ``CharFields`` - so please read the
release notes carefully when upgrading!

Search improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Search results can be now be sorted

* If you're search backend supports it, spelling suggestions will be shown if
  the search term doesn't lead to any results.

* Only products are returned by the core search view.  Other content types in
  your search index are filtered out (`#370`_).

Improvements to signals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oscar signals have been improved and consolidated, making it easier to hook
into user journeys and extract analytics.

Changes to existing signals:

- The :ref:`basket_addition_signal` signal now passes the ``request`` as an additional
  kwarg.

- The :ref:`user_registered_signal` signal now passes the ``request`` as an additional
  kwarg.

New signals:

- A :ref:`start_checkout_signal` signal is now raised when the customer begins the
  checkout process.

See the :doc:`signals docs </ref/signals>` for more details.

Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Customers can delete their profiles from within the account section.

* :attr:`~oscar.core.application.Application.permissions_map` now supports more than two
  lists to evaluate permissions.

* Formset handling in
  :class:`~oscar.apps.dashboard.catalogue.views.ProductCreateUpdateView` has
  been simplified and now easily allows adding further formsets.

* Increased required version of Django Haystack to 2.1

* The dashboard's Bootstrap and the Bootstrap JS has been bumped to 2.3.2, the
  latest release of version 2.

* The dashboard's category handling now has the ability to directly create
  child categories.

* Oscar's error messages now have their own CSS class, ``error-block``
  (`ef3ccf08a7`_).

* It is now possible to disable the redirect that happens when a product or
  category's slug changed and an old URL is used (`b920f8ba`_).

* :class:`~oscar.apps.payment.forms.BankCardNumberField` now allows specifying
  accepted card types (`32b7249`_).

* Several slug fields have been turned into the newly introduced
  :class:`~oscar.models.fields.AutoSlugField` to ensure that generated slugs
  are unique.

* Widget initialisation can now be prevented with adding the ``no-widget-init``
  class. Issues around widget initialisation in the dashboard promotions have
  been resolved.

* The access function used to determine dashboard's menu entries' visibility
  is now settable via
  :doc:`OSCAR_DASHBOARD_DEFAULT_ACCESS_FUNCTION</ref/settings>`.

* Vouchers start and end times are now datetimes instead of dates; allowing
  "lunch-time deals" etc.

* Product classes can now be added from the dashboard. Editing options and
  attributes is not yet supported though.

* ``OSCAR_SLUG_FUNCTION`` now accepts both string notation and a callable.
  Converting unicode characters into ASCII has been made part of Oscar's
  default slug function to make it optional. That means a custom slugifier
  function can now chose to keep unicode characters in slugs, which might be of
  interest for international URLs.

  address anymore (`be04d46639`_).

Backwards incompatible changes in 0.7
=====================================

.. warning::

    Fields and models have been removed from Oscar. If you used them, you must
    ensure you create/extend the affected models appropriately.

* Oscar has dropped support for Django 1.4. However, if Oscar continues to
  support the ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE`` setting so sites that use separate
  profile models aren't forced to convert to a single user model in order to
  use Oscar 0.7.

* ``AbstractProduct.status`` was an unused ``CharField`` provided for convenience
  as it's a commonly required field. But a different field type was often
  required, and as changing it is much harder than adding a field with the
  desired type, the field has been removed.

* ``Contributor``, ``ContributorRole``, the through-model ``ProductContributor``
  and their abstract versions have been removed as they were unused and too
  specific to the domain of book shops.

* ``ProductCategory.is_canonical`` was an unused ``BooleanField`` and has been
  removed.

* ``Order.basket_id`` was a ``PositiveIntegerField`` containing the primary key of the
  associated basket. It's been refactored to be a nullable ``ForeignKey`` and
  is now called "basket".

* `#1123`_ - The URL structure of ``ProductCreateRedirectView`` has been changed to use
  the product class' slug instead of the primary key. It's necessary to update
  URLs pointing to that view.

* ``ProductListView`` has been removed as it wasn't needed any more after the
  search improvements. The old URL route still works.

* Accessing categories by just slug instead of primary key and slug had been
  unofficially deprecated for 0.6, and is removed now.

* `#1251`_ - Form related templates have been refactored. If you've modified
  them, your templates might need updating.

* If you use a custom slugifier function and want to keep Oscar's slug
  behaviour unchanged, you need to explicitly call ``unidecode()`` in your
  function.

Migrations

.. warning::

    The reviews app has not been under migration control so far. Please ensure
    you follow South's guidelines on how to `convert an app`_. Essentially,
    you will have to run:

        $ ./manage.py migrate reviews 0001 --fake

.. warning::

    A lot of Oscar apps have data migrations for CharFields before ``null=True``
    is removed in the following schema migration. If you have extended such an
    app and use your own migrations, then you will need to first convert
    affected ``None``'s to ``''`` yourself; see the data migrations for our
    approach.
