Backwards incompatible changes in 0.7
=====================================

.. warning::

    Fields and models have been removed from Oscar. If you used them, you must
    ensure you create/extend the affected models appropriately.

* ``AbstractProduct.status`` was an unused ``CharField`` provided for convenience
  as it's a commonly required field. But a different field type was often
  required, and as changing it is much harder than adding a field with the
  desired type, the field has been removed.

* ``Contributor``, ``ContributorRole``, the through-model ``ProductContributor``
  and their abstract versions have been removed as they were unused and too
  specific to the domain of book shops.

* ``ProductCategory.is_canonical`` was an unused ``BooleanField`` and has been
  removed.

* ``Order.basket_id`` was a ``PositiveIntegerField`` containing the primary key of the
  associated basket. It's been refactored to be a nullable ``ForeignKey`` and
  is now called "basket".

* `#1123`_ - The URL structure of ``ProductCreateRedirectView`` has been changed to use
  the product class' slug instead of the primary key. It's necessary to update
  URLs pointing to that view.

.. _`#1123`: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar/pull/1123
