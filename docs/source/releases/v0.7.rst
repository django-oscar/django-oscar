Backwards incompatible changes in 0.7
=====================================

* ``Order.basket_id`` was a ``PositiveIntegerField`` containing the primary key of the
  associated basket. It's been refactored to be a nullable ``ForeignKey`` and
  is now called "basket".

* ``ProductCategory.is_canonical`` was an unused ``BooleanField`` and has been
  dropped.

* `#1123`_ - The URL structure of ``ProductCreateRedirectView`` has been changed to use
  the product class' slug instead of the primary key. It's necessary to update
  URLs pointing to that view.

.. _`#1123`: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar/pull/1123
