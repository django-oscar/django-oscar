Oscar 0.6.2 release notes
=========================

This is Oscar 0.6.2.  It fixes an unfortunate regression introduced in 0.6.1 as well
as a couple of bugs.

Overriding models
-----------------

Commit `fa1f8403`_ changed the way signal receivers were registered.  While
this helped work around issues with the latest debug toolbar, it also broke the
way custom models were imported.  This happened as the relocated receiver
imports caused core models to be imported before local ones.

This is fixed in 0.6.2 by `reverting the original commit`_.  Users of the debug
toolbar are recommended to follow the `explicit installation instructions`_ to
avoid any circular import issues that `fa1f8403`_ was introduced to solve..

See `#1159`_ for more details.

Bug fixes
=========

The following bugs were fixed:

* `#1157`_ - Ensure group products have a price submitted to the search backend
  when indexing.

* `#1127`_ - Remove a circular dependency bug around importing the `StockAlert`
  model when indexing.
