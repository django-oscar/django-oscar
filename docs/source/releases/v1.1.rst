What's new in Oscar 1.1?
------------------------

* The frontend templates have been updated to use Bootstrap 3 instead of version 2 (`#1576`_)
* The icon and caption of `django-tables2` tables can be set directly on the `Table` object, if it
  derives from :class:`~oscar.apps.dashboard.tables.DashboardTable`. The caption can be localized
  in singular and plural. (`#1482`_)

.. _minor_changes_in_1.1:

Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The `Order.date_placed` field can now be set explicitly rather than using the
  `auto_now_add` behaviour (`#1558`_).

- The settings ``OSCAR_BASKET_COOKIE_SECURE`` and ``OSCAR_RECENTLY_VIEWED_COOKIE_SECURE``
  are introduced to set the ``secure`` flag on the relevant cookies.

- Previously, all views handled in Oscar's Application class were decorated
  with the permissions_required decorator. That decorator would not do
  anything if used with an empty set of permissions. But it was raised as an
  issue, and now views not requiring permissions are not decorated at all.

- Properly redirect users to the checkout page after a guest user created an
  account.

Backwards incompatible changes in 1.1
-------------------------------------

Misc
~~~~

* The :class:`~oscar.apps.shipping.abstract_models.AbstractWeightBased` shipping
  method now allows zero-weight baskets to have a non-zero shipping cost
  (`#1565`_). This means that sites that rely on zero-weight baskets having no
  change will need to introduce a new weight band that covers this edge case.

* The methods :method:`~oscar.apps.offer.utils.Applicator.apply` and
  :method:`~oscar.apps.offer.utils.Applicatior.get_offers` changed their
  arguments to `(basket, user=None, request=None)`. (`#1677`_)
