What's new in Oscar 0.8?
========================

Minor cleanup around shipping methods
-------------------------------------

* The models of the shipping app now have abstract base classes, similar to
  the rest of Oscar.

* The legacy ``ShippingMethod`` name of the interface of the shipping app has
  been removed. Inherit from ``shipping.base.Base`` for the class instead, and
  inherit from ``shipping.abstract_models.AbstractBase`` for model-based
  shipping methods.

* ``oscar.apps.shipping.Scales`` has been renamed and moved to
  ``oscar.apps.shipping.scales.Scale``, and is now overridable.

* ``WeightBand.upper_limit`` is now a ``DecimalField``, just like the other
  weight-related fields.

Customisation improvements
--------------------------

Oscar's views are now dynamically imported. This means that they can be
overridden like most other classes in Oscar; overriding the related
Application instance is not necessary any more. Updated instructions are
available in :doc:`/topics/customisation`.

US demo site
------------

To help developers building sites for the US, a new example Oscar site has been
included in the repo. This customises core Oscar to treat all prices as
excluding tax and then calculate and apply taxes once the shipping address is
known.

See :ref:`us_site` for more information.

.. _minor_changes_in_0.8:

Minor changes
-------------

* The ``OSCAR_CURRENCY_LOCALE`` setting has been removed. The locale is now
  automatically determined from the current language. This ensures prices are
  always shown in the correct format when switching languages.

* The login and registration view now redirects staff users to the dashboard
  after logging in. It also employs flash messages to welcome returning and
  newly registered users.

* The basket middleware now assigns a ``basket_hash`` attribute to the
  ``request`` instance. This provides a hook for basket caching.
