Compatibility
=============

Oscar 0.8 is compatible with Django 1.5-1.7. Support for Python 2.6 has been
dropped; it works with Python 2.7, Python 3.3 and Python 3.4.


What's new in Oscar 0.8?
========================

Minor cleanup around shipping methods
-------------------------------------

* The models of the shipping app now have abstract base classes, similar to
  the rest of Oscar.

* The legacy ``ShippingMethod`` name of the interface of the shipping app has
  been removed. Inherit from ``shipping.base.Base`` for the class instead, and
  inherit from ``shipping.abstract_models.AbstractBase`` for model-based
  shipping methods.

* ``oscar.apps.shipping.Scales`` has been renamed and moved to
  ``oscar.apps.shipping.scales.Scale``, and is now overridable.

* ``WeightBand.upper_limit`` is now a ``DecimalField``, just like the other
  weight-related fields.

Customisation improvements
--------------------------

Oscar's views are now dynamically imported. This means that they can be
overridden like most other classes in Oscar; overridding the related
Application instance is not necessary any more. Updated instructions are
available in :doc:`/topics/customisation`.

Minor changes
-------------

* The ``OSCAR_CURRENCY_LOCALE`` setting has been removed. The locale is now
  automatically determined from the current language. This ensures prices are
  always shown in the correct format when switching languages.
