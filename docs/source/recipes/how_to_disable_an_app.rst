How to disable an app's URLs
============================

Suppose you don't want to use Oscar's dashboard but use your own.  The way to do
this is to modify the URLs config to exclude the URLs from the app in question.

You need to use your own root 'application' instance which gives you control
over the URLs structure.  So your root ``urls.py`` should have::

    # urls.py
    from myproject.app import application

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        (r'', include(application.urls)),
    )

where ``application`` is a subclass of ``oscar.app.Shop`` which overrides the 
link to the dashboard app::

    # myproject/app.py
    from oscar.app import Shop
    from oscar.core.application import Application

    class MyShop(Shop):

        # Override the core dashboard_app instance to use a blank application 
        # instance.  This means no dashboard URLs are included.
        dashboard_app = Application()

The only remaining task is to ensure your templates don't reference any
dashboard URLs.
