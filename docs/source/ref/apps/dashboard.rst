Dashboard
=========

The dashboard is the backend interface for managing the store. That includes the
product catalogue, orders and stock, offers etc. It is intended as a
complete replacement of the Django admin interface.
The app itself only contains a view that serves as a kind of homepage, and
some logic for managing the navigation (in ``nav.py``). There's several sub-apps
that are responsible for managing the different parts of the Oscar store.

Permission-based dashboard
--------------------------
Staff users (users with ``is_staff==True``) get access to all views in the
dashboard. To better support Oscar's use for marketplace scenarios, the
permission-based dashboard has been introduced. If a non-staff user has
the ``partner.dashboard_access`` permission set, they are given access to a subset
of views, and their access to products and orders is limited.

:class:`~oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractPartner` instances
have a :attr:`~oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractPartner.users` field.
Prior to Oscar 0.6, this field was not used. Since Oscar 0.6, it is used solely
for modelling dashboard access.

If a non-staff user with the ``partner.dashboard_access`` permission is in
:attr:`~oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractPartner.users`, they can:

* Create products. It is enforced that at least one stock record's partner has
  the current user in ``users``.
* Update products. At least one stock record must have the user in the stock
  record's partner's ``users``.
* Delete and list products. Limited to products the user is allowed to update.
* Managing orders. Similar to products, a user get access if one of an order's
  lines is associated with a matching partner.

For many marketplace scenarios, it will make sense to ensure at checkout that
a basket only contains lines from one partner.
Please note that the dashboard currently ignores any other permissions,
including `Django's default permissions`_.

.. note::

  The permission-based dashboard currently does not support parent or child
  products. Supporting this requires a modelling change. If you require this,
  please get in touch so we can first learn about your use case.
