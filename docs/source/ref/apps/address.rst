======================
``oscar.apps.address``
======================

The address app provides core address models - it doesn't provide any views or
other functionality.  Of the 5 abstract models, only 2 have a non-abstract
version in ``oscar.apps.address.models`` - the others are used by the order app
to provide shipping and billing address models.
