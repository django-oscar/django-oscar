======================
Building your own shop
======================

For simplicity, let's assume you're building a new e-commerce project from
scratch and have decided to use Oscar.  Let's call this shop 'frobshop'

.. tip::

    You can always review the set-up of the
    :doc:`Sandbox site <sandbox>` in case you have trouble with
    the below instructions.

Install Oscar and its dependencies
==================================

Install Oscar (which will install Django as a dependency), then create the
project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkvirtualenv oscar
    $ pip install django-oscar
    $ django-admin.py startproject frobshop

If you do not have mkvirtualenv, then replace that line with::

    $ virtualenv oscar
    $ . ./oscar/bin/activate
    (oscar) $

This will create a folder ``frobshop`` for your project. It is highly
recommended to install Oscar in a virtualenv.

.. attention::

    Please ensure that ``pillow``, a fork of the the Python Imaging Library
    (PIL), gets installed with JPEG support. Supported formats are printed
    when ``pillow`` is first installed.
    Instructions_ on how to get JPEG support are highly platform specific,
    but guides for ``PIL`` should work for ``pillow`` as well. Generally
    speaking, you need to ensure that ``libjpeg-dev`` is installed and found
    during installation.

    .. _Instructions: http://www.google.com/search?q=install+pil+with+jpeg+support

Django settings
===============

First, edit your settings file ``frobshop.frobshop.settings.py`` to import all of Oscar's default settings.

.. code-block:: django

    from oscar.defaults import *


Now modify your ``TEMPLATES`` to include the main Oscar template directory and add the extra
context processors.

.. code-block:: django

    from oscar import OSCAR_MAIN_TEMPLATE_DIR

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            'DIRS': [
                os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'),
                OSCAR_MAIN_TEMPLATE_DIR
            ],
            'APP_DIRS': True,
            'OPTIONS': {
                'context_processors': [
                    'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                    'django.template.context_processors.request',
                    'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                    'django.template.context_processors.i18n',
                    'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',

                    'oscar.apps.search.context_processors.search_form',
                    'oscar.apps.checkout.context_processors.checkout',
                    'oscar.apps.customer.notifications.context_processors.notifications',
                    'oscar.core.context_processors.metadata',
                ],
            },
        },
    ]

Next, modify ``INSTALLED_APPS`` to be a list, and add ``django.contrib.sites``,
``django.contrib.flatpages``, Oscar's core apps, and third-party apps that Oscar
depends on. Also set ``SITE_ID``:

.. code-block:: django

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',

        'django.contrib.sites',
        'django.contrib.flatpages',

        'oscar',
        'oscar.apps.analytics',
        'oscar.apps.checkout',
        'oscar.apps.address',
        'oscar.apps.shipping',
        'oscar.apps.catalogue',
        'oscar.apps.catalogue.reviews',
        'oscar.apps.partner',
        'oscar.apps.basket',
        'oscar.apps.payment',
        'oscar.apps.offer',
        'oscar.apps.order',
        'oscar.apps.customer',
        'oscar.apps.search',
        'oscar.apps.voucher',
        'oscar.apps.wishlists',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.reports',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.users',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.orders',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.catalogue',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.offers',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.partners',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.pages',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.ranges',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.reviews',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.vouchers',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.communications',
        'oscar.apps.dashboard.shipping',

        # 3rd-party apps that oscar depends on
        'widget_tweaks',
        'haystack',
        'treebeard',
        'sorl.thumbnail',
        'django_tables2',
    ]

    SITE_ID = 1

Note that Oscar requires ``django.contrib.flatpages`` which isn't
included by default. ``flatpages`` also requires ``django.contrib.sites``.
More info about installing ``flatpages`` is in the `Django docs`_.

.. _`Django docs`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/flatpages/#installation

.. tip::

    Oscar's default templates use django-widget-tweaks_ but it's
    optional really.  You may decide to use your own templates that
    don't use either.

.. _django-widget-tweaks: https://github.com/kmike/django-widget-tweaks

Next, add ``oscar.apps.basket.middleware.BasketMiddleware`` and
``django.contrib.flatpages.middleware.FlatpageFallbackMiddleware`` to
your ``MIDDLEWARE`` setting.

.. code-block:: django

    MIDDLEWARE = (
        ...
        'oscar.apps.basket.middleware.BasketMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.flatpages.middleware.FlatpageFallbackMiddleware',
    )

Set your auth backends to:

.. code-block:: django

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'oscar.apps.customer.auth_backends.EmailBackend',
        'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    )

to allow customers to sign in using an email address rather than a username.

Ensure that your media and static files are `configured correctly`_. This means
at the least setting ``MEDIA_URL`` and ``STATIC_URL``. If you're serving files
locally, you'll also need to set ``MEDIA_ROOT`` and ``STATIC_ROOT``.
Check out the `sandbox settings`_ for a working example. If you're serving
files from a remote storage (e.g. Amazon S3), you must manually copy a
:ref:`"Image not found" image <missing-image-label>` into ``MEDIA_ROOT``.

.. _`configured correctly`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/static-files/
.. _sandbox settings: https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar/blob/master/sandbox/settings.py#L102


URLs
====

Alter your ``frobshop/urls.py`` to include Oscar's URLs. You can also include
the Django admin for debugging purposes. But please note that Oscar makes no
attempts at having that be a workable interface; admin integration exists
to ease the life of developers.

If you have more than one language set your Django settings for ``LANGUAGES``,
you will also need to include Django's i18n URLs:

.. code-block:: django

    from django.apps import apps
    from django.conf.urls import include, url  # < Django-2.0
    # from django.urls import include, path  # > Django-2.0
    from django.contrib import admin

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^i18n/', include('django.conf.urls.i18n')),
        # path('i18n/', include('django.conf.urls.i18n')),  # > Django-2.0

        # The Django admin is not officially supported; expect breakage.
        # Nonetheless, it's often useful for debugging.

        url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
        # path('admin/', admin.site.urls),  # > Django-2.0

        url(r'^', include(apps.get_app_config('oscar').urls[0])),
        # path('', include(apps.get_app_config('oscar').urls[0])),  # > Django-2.0
    ]


Search backend
==============
If you're happy with basic search for now, you can just add Haystack's simple
backend to the ``HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS`` option in your Django settings:

.. code-block:: django

    HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'haystack.backends.simple_backend.SimpleEngine',
        },
    }

Oscar uses Haystack to abstract away from different search backends.
Unfortunately, writing backend-agnostic code is nonetheless hard and
Apache Solr is currently the only supported production-grade backend. Your
Haystack config could look something like this:

.. code-block:: django

    HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'haystack.backends.solr_backend.SolrEngine',
            'URL': 'http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr',
            'INCLUDE_SPELLING': True,
        },
    }

Oscar includes a sample schema to get started with Solr. More information can
be found in the
:doc:`recipe on getting Solr up and running</howto/how_to_setup_solr>`.

Database
========

Check your database settings. A quick way to get started is to use SQLite:

.. code-block:: django

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',
            'USER': '',
            'PASSWORD': '',
            'HOST': '',
            'PORT': '',
            'ATOMIC_REQUESTS': True,
        }
    }

Note that we recommend using ``ATOMIC_REQUESTS`` to tie transactions to
requests.

Create database
---------------

Oscar ships with migrations. Django's migration framework will detect them
automatically and will do the right thing.
Create the database and the shop should be browsable:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py runserver

You should now have an empty, but running Oscar install that you can browse at
http://localhost:8000.


Initial data
============

The default checkout process requires a shipping address with a country.  Oscar
uses a model for countries with flags that indicate which are valid shipping
countries and so the ``country`` database table must be populated before
a customer can check out.

The easiest way to achieve this is to use country data from the `pycountry`_
package. Oscar ships with a management command to parse that data:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pycountry
    [...]
    $ python manage.py oscar_populate_countries

By default, this command will mark all countries as a shipping country. Call
it with the ``--no-shipping`` option to prevent that. You then need to
manually mark at least one country as a shipping country.

.. _pycountry: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycountry


Creating product classes and fulfillment partners
=================================================

Every Oscar deployment needs at least one
:class:`product class <oscar.apps.catalogue.abstract_models.AbstractProductClass>`
and one
:class:`fulfillment partner <oscar.apps.partner.abstract_models.AbstractPartner>`.
These aren't created automatically as they're highly specific to the shop you
want to build.

When managing your catalogue you should always use the Oscar dashboard, which
provides the necessary functionality. Use your Django superuser email and password to login to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/ and create instances of both there.

It is important to note that the Django admin site is not supported. It may
or may not work and is only included in the sandbox for developer's
convenience.

For a deployment setup, we recommend creating product classes
as `data migration`_.

.. _`data migration`: http://codeinthehole.com/writing/prefer-data-migrations-to-initial-data/

Defining the order pipeline
===========================

The order management in Oscar relies on the order pipeline that
defines all the statuses an order can have and the possible transitions
for any given status. Statuses in Oscar are not just used for an order
but are handled on the line level as well to be able to handle partial
shipping of an order.

The order status pipeline is different for every shop which means that
changing it is fairly straightforward in Oscar. The pipeline is defined in
your ``settings.py`` file using the ``OSCAR_ORDER_STATUS_PIPELINE`` setting.
You also need to specify the initial status for an order and a line item in
``OSCAR_INITIAL_ORDER_STATUS`` and ``OSCAR_INITIAL_LINE_STATUS``
respectively.

To give you an idea of what an order pipeline might look like take a look
at the Oscar sandbox settings:

.. code-block:: django

    OSCAR_INITIAL_ORDER_STATUS = 'Pending'
    OSCAR_INITIAL_LINE_STATUS = 'Pending'
    OSCAR_ORDER_STATUS_PIPELINE = {
        'Pending': ('Being processed', 'Cancelled',),
        'Being processed': ('Processed', 'Cancelled',),
        'Cancelled': (),
    }

Defining the order status pipeline is simply a dictionary of where each
status is given as a key. Possible transitions into other statuses can be
specified as an iterable of status names. An empty iterable defines an
end point in the pipeline.

With these three settings defined in your project you'll be able to see
the different statuses in the order management dashboard.

Next steps
==========

The next step is to implement the business logic of your domain on top of
Oscar. The fun part.
