Running tests
-------------

Oscar uses pytest_ to run the tests, which can be invoked using::

    $ py.test

.. _pytest: http://pytest.org/latest/

You can run a subset of the tests by passing a path:

    $ py.test tests/integration/offer/test_availability.py

To run an individual test class, use::

    $ py.test tests/integration/offer/test_availability.py::TestASuspendedOffer

(Note the '::'.)

To run an individual test, use::

    $ py.test tests/integration/offer/test_availability.py::TestASuspendedOffer::test_is_unavailable

You can also run tests which match an expression via::

    $ py.test tests/integration/offer/test_availability.py -k is_unavailable

Testing against different setups
--------------------------------

To run all tests against multiple versions of Django and Python, use detox_::

    $ detox

You need to have all Python interpreters to test against installed on your 
system. All other requirements are downloaded automatically.
detox_ is a wrapper around tox_, creating the environments and running the tests
in parallel. This greatly speeds up the process.

Kinds of tests
--------------

Tests are split into 3 folders:

* integration - These are for tests that exercise a collection or chain of
  units, like testing a template tag.  

* functional - These should be as close to "end-to-end" as possible.  Most of
  these tests should use WebTest to simulate the behaviour of a user browsing
  the site.

Naming tests
------------

When running a subset of tests, Oscar uses the spec_ plugin.  It is a good
practice to name your test cases and methods so that the spec output reads well.
For example::

    $ py.test tests/integration/catalogue/test_product.py --spec
